### Rules

1. Fetch Upstream and Git Pull before doing anything else to avoid conflict.
2. Comment well (in commit and group chat)
3. Be Respectful (at least try...)
4. Do not change **EVERYTHING** on the last day.
5. Do bare minimum first, make project work and then make it pretty.
6. No getting high or alcohol until after the project.
7. Do not delete other member's code without letting other members know.
8. When there is a problem, write it down in the README.

### Problem

1. The background that we are using was supposed to be a splash page but ended up being a background because it keeps sticking to the other pages.
