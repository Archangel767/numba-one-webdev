1. ## **[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)**

* We’re a nonprofit community that helps you learn to code by building projects. (Ref. Freecodecamp.org)

  *I discovered Freecodecamp before I entered school, I thought there has to be a way for me to learn how to code before I start school, after reading Reddit reviews, people posted some of their success stories and became a full stack developers with the help of Freecodecamp. They also offer some youtube videos from their contributors that you can watch.*
* **Pros:** Free, Variety of lessons, Badges, Certificates
* **Cons**: not updated.

2. ## **[Odin Projects](https://www.theodinproject.com/)**

* The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high-quality education. (Ref. theodinproject.com)

  > *Odin Projects was the first website I used to learn to code, Odin projects will take you to the very beginning, from understanding OS, command line to HTML and CSS. I learned how to change my OS from windows to ubuntu with Odin projects, they have a discord channel and a lot of developers in that community are very helpful. Their #1 rule is research first and then when you hit a wall that's when you should ask*.
* **Pros:** Free, Variety of lessons, Badges, Certificates
* **Cons**: not updated, not very detailed on challenges, a lot of reading.

3. ## **[Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript)**

* Exercism exists to help as many people as possible attain fluency in any programming language they want. Programming skills can be a source of great fun and a route to social mobility and we want to help people regardless of their backgrounds or their motivations. (Ref. Exercism.org)

  > *I have not really navigated to this one but it seems to be like Freecodecamp and Odin Projects, but they might have newer content. The website interface is really inviting.*

4. ## **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)**

* When we started Codecademy, our goal was to give anyone in the world the ability to learn the skills they’d need to succeed in the 21st century. We set out to create a new, interactive way of learning — making it engaging, flexible, and accessible for as many people as possible. Since then, we have helped millions of people worldwide unlock modern technical skills and reach their full potential through code. (Ref. Codecademy.com)

  > *Codecademy is the last Bootcamp website that I have tried before I started school, it is very much like Freecodecamp and Odin projects, but the nice thing about Codecademy, is it is more updated, they have their own materials for student's learning, they also have videos that you can watch someone type and youtube videos of their own.*
* **Pros:** Updated, Variety of Lessons, Badges, Certificate
* **Cons:** Not free

5. ## **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)**

* Skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of classes for creative and curious people, on topics including illustration, design, photography, video, freelancing, and more. On Skillshare, members come together to find inspiration and take the next step in their creative journey. (Ref. Skillshare.com)

  > *I have not fully navigated to this website as well, but I did see it on LinkedIn. It is a website where you can learn coding, but not only that they also have a monthly kit for interview preparations, so people who are getting ready for technical interviews can definitely benefit from this.*
