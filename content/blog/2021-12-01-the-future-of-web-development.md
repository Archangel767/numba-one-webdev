***What is the future of web development?***

Web Development is a shifting industry, 15 years back into the past the world wide web was completely different. While one may not be able to realize the day-to-day changes as they occur, in the next few months, we will look back and realize how much has changed. Since web development is one of the fastest-paced industries, it is essential for web developers to learn and predict the upcoming trends, new languages, and technology in the industry — as such with:

Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Intelligence is the biggest invention of Humans as a race! Every big company and business has implemented some sort of AI to ease out their work. This is the next big thing in the coming years. One of the latest developments in UX development is the grid that simplifies the whole web development process. In the future, a web developer has to work as per the demand of the clients hence AI can be seen as a good option.

Virtual Environment: The pandemic has locked up people inside their premises and this is the time when Virtual Environment will come into play and give us real-time experience while inside the four walls of the home. With the advent of VR technology now industries are demanding UX developers who have the extra skills to develop VR applications or pages that may allow them to showcase their products to their potential clients.

***Will AI systems impact the future of web dev?***

Many have the theory that front-end web development will be automated out of existence by AI systems that can design the look and feel of a webpage based on customer experience and auto generate codes with the help of Machine learning, however they might just be very general human interaction stuff, and the results are often not scalable. In order to get any meaningful UI and UX design a robot would still have to take instructions, and instructions are literally codes programmers feed the robot.

Contrary to what the media would have you believe, the AI hype we are constantly hearing about is still considered weak AI and is largely based on technology developed decades ago, and the problem with automation is that it has to deal with what’s already working and established. And because the technology we deal with is constantly changing due to how the user wants to experience things, automation will always be a step behind with the constant shift in technology.

When building a Rest API with any front end language, you can create an elaborate set of rules of how to build a Rest API based on user stories, then make the AI build/Generate the backend

and front-end from the list of rulesets, essentially the application would still be built by a web-developers. AI might not be able to fully impact the future of web development, but it is capable of creating tools that make a developers life easier.
