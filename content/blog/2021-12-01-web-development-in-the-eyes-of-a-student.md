This article might not be the usual article you would see on a tech site, I mean, who writes about being a newbie right, while some might not find this interesting, some might see this as the sign they are looking for, whether if it is changing your career or what you want to be after high school. One this is for sure though, that we have all been here before.

When I decided to change my career from working in administration to a developer, I thought it would easy as one, two, three because of my experience in some low-code-no-code websites (nerd term). When I started school, I realized, being a developer is solving puzzles and loving them. It is time-consuming, you have to read documentation, reviews, watch videos and try it out, getting errors feels like hitting a wall and being lost, I cannot count with my fingers how many times have I told myself, “I thought I got it….”. 

I hope I have not  scared you away. There is a lot of good things that I have learned and felt from changing my career. I first learned HTML & CSS, the backbone of programming, I was able to make a header, a navigation bar with all the hovering buttons and changing colors, I was able to put pictures and make a gallery, a footer with my name on it as the creator, that is when I fell in love with being a developer, I can do all this with just typing on my keyboard and my imagination. I started researching about famous developers and my word, I saw the best website portfolios, my fire is fuelled. 

I learned JavaScript soon after, I had fun learning how to make a toggle button, how to use APIs and send it to my page, one of my projects, I was able to create my very own weather app, I was ecstatic. We learned how to deploy websites to databases, which is cool, I felt like a spy or Ramsay from Fast and Furious! Soon after, we learned how to use CSS frameworks and JavaScript frameworks to top our cake! 

The learning process was bumpy indeed, but it was all worth it, when I look back three months ago, I never thought I could do things like this, being a developer is fulfilling and you might get errors along the way, but if you are super frustrated, take five or ten even, drink some water, think about something else other than codes, reset your mind and look at your code again, even the best ones miss a letter or a comma and if that does not work, always remember that the community is big, have another pair of eyes to check if you are missing a part of your code. Read the documentation again, watch a youtube video. but whatever you do, do not give up.

If you are planning to enter a boot camp as I did, I would suggest treating it like a real job, be open-minded! JavaScript might not be your favorite because it is confusing, many would agree but maybe you hate it now because you do not understand it, but just try and take a second look, just like relationships, sometimes it is better the second time around! Lol. 

If I have not bored you up until this point, I hope I inspired you. One code at a time everyone!
